For my website portfolio, I chose to make a website about my cats. I was going to make a job resume page for myself but changed my mind, because I wanted to have more fun with it. I’ve found that html makes WAY more sense in my brain than CSS. For some reason whenever I try to adjust the CSS colors or fonts, etc. I get so tripped up and mess something up, or it just doesn’t show up how I wanted it to. Regardless, I feel pretty good about my website where it is now (pictures of my cats are really cute so I had fun). Additionally, I know that in finals we may revise some of our projects and I would love to sit down with CSS and try to really make this site look how I wanted it to. I feel as though I kind of settled with how it looks, and I’d like to walk away prouder than I am after some revisions.
