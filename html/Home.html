    <h1>Bean and Macky: A collection</h1>
    <p>Here are my two cats pretending they don't hate each other. The two of them truly are polar opposites, but they still love each other nonetheless.</p>

    <h2>This is Macky</h2>
    <p>He is old, fat, and extremely anxious. Bean makes him incredibly anxious due to her constant energy and the chaos she causes.</p>

    <h2>This is Bean</h2>
    <p>She's 4, super social, and loves bothering Macky. She just wants to play!</p>
