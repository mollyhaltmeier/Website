    <h1>Welcome to Macky's Page!</h1>
    <p>Here's Macky in his usual spot in the sun</p>
    <img src="shadows.jpg">
    <p>Isn't he just so cute! He is currently in loaf mode, which is determined by the similarities between this sitting cat and a load. I would have to say that he is a 10/10 loaf</p>
    <img src="max.jpg">
    <p>This is Macky once again laying in the sun. Despite his adorable floofiness, if Macky is approached by anyone he doesn't know, he will sprint directly under the bed. I try not to take it personally</p>
