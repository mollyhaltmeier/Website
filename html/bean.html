    <h1>Welcome to Bean's Page!</h1>
    <p>Bean is my very best friend and she has a huge personality</p>
    <img src="sittinweird.jpg">
    <p>Bean loves attention and she truly cannot go more than ten minutes without someone petting her. Plus, who can resist?! Look at her tiny feet!</p>
    <img src="toes.jpg">
    <p>As much as Bean loves, being pet she can also frequently be found in the living room of my house, fighting sleep so hard in order to socialize, but failing of course.</p>

    <p>Not only, does Bean love to be in the room with everyone, but she LOVES the new window sills in the house</p>
